# Price Tracker app

A personal project created out of the misery of missing when websites list their sales. 

It utilizes the structured data properties of *most* product webpages, such as JSON-LD and microdata to fetch an item and its related data accurately. The application scrapes every 6 hours and then sends an email to the user if the price of an item has dropped since its last scrape.
